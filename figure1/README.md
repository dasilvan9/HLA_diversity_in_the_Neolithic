# Figure 1: PCA, map, qpAdm and supervised ADMIXTURE

This subdirectory contains the script for generating the plots for Figure 1 of the manuscript.

## How to Run

To generate the plots, you can either:
- Run the script from the command line:
  ```bash
  python plot_pca.py
  ```
- Or load the script into an IDE (e.g., Spyder) for step-by-step execution and exploration.

## Input Files

The script requires the following input files:

- **Table with PCA and admixture results** (`../data/PCA_data.tsv`): This file is a merged dataset containing:
  - Sample metadata (`.anno` file)
  - PCA results (`.evec` file generated by `smartpca`)
  - Results from supervised ADMIXTURE (`.Q` files)

- **Additional Data** (`../data/AdditionalFile1.xlsx`): Contains supplementary data from the manuscript. The sheet named `"DataS4"` includes results from `qpAdm`.
